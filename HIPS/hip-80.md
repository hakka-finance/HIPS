### Summary
Initiation of HAKKA Staking Model

### Details

As we announced in the https://medium.com/hakkafinance/introduce-hakka-staking-shakka-d4d231fcf480?source=friends_link&sk=b890d6c14c6bf99bc9188c2fb8dc3db9: 

To create a better HAKKA ecosystem, we have designed a Staking Mechanism of $HAKKA to align the interests and incentives between HAKKA holders and governance participants.

The implementation of HAKKA staking would separate the Beneficiary Rights of $HAKKA holders from Voting Power. Those who stake $HAKKA will be granted a certificate ERC20 token: “sHAKKA”. Meanwhile, voting power will be bound with the address while sHAKKA is minted.

We would request the final confirmation of implementing this feature through HAKKA governance.


### Options
1. Yes. Let's adopt it!
2. No. We should not.
