| 81 | Migration HAKKA Governance to Snapshot  | 0x0E29e5AbbB5FD88e28b2d355774e73BD47dE3bcd | 2021-04-13 13:00 | 1 | 12232365 |


### Summary
Migrate HAKKA Governance to Snapshot.org

### Details

Our voting system gov.hakka.finance has accompanied us for a long time and has provided us with a very good user experience. Nevertheless, Snapshot has been maintained by a much more powerful ecosystem. Therefore, we have proposed to migrate to Snapshot and join the big family of DeFi governance. If this proposal is approved, we will keep on contribute ourselves to the Snapshot community and make it a better place for future HAKKA governance.

### Options
1. Sure. Let's migrate to Snapshot
2. No. We should keep using gov.hakka.finance
